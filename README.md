# Restuarant Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a restaurant to understand revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance. Using Excel, we explored the dataset, calculated key metrics, and created a dashboard to visualize insights. The goal is to show which products and time periods contribute most to revenue, and how customer orders vary throughout the day.

## Project Description
This project analyzes restaurant sales data to understand revenue performance, customer purchasing patterns, and product demand across different time periods. Using Microsoft Excel, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), built PivotTables, and created an interactive dashboard to track key performance indicators such as total revenue, order volume, average order value, product category performance, and customer behavior.

The analysis focuses on identifying what drives revenue over time, how customer activity varies by time of day, and how the product mix changes across different periods. Insights from the project highlight the relationship between order volume and revenue, differences in spending behavior by time of day, and the low rate of returning customers. The final output is a visually structured Excel dashboard designed to support data-driven business decisions.

## Business Questions
- How does revenue vary over time (monthly)?
- Which meal category generates the most revenue?
- Which time of day generates the highest revenue and order volume?
- Are there returning customers and what is their impact on revenue?
