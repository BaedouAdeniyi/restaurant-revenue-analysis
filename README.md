# Restuarant Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview
An Excel-based analysis of restaurant sales data focused on revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The project features an interactive dashboard built using PivotTables and KPIs to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Description
This project analyzes restaurant sales data to understand revenue performance, customer purchasing patterns, and product demand across different time periods. Using Microsoft Excel, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), built PivotTables, and created an interactive dashboard to track key performance indicators such as total revenue, order volume, average order value, product category performance, and customer behavior.

The analysis focuses on identifying what drives revenue over time, how customer activity varies by time of day, and how the product mix changes across different periods. Insights from the project highlight the relationship between order volume and revenue, differences in spending behavior by time of day, and the low rate of returning customers. The final output is a visually structured Excel dashboard designed to support data-driven business decisions.
